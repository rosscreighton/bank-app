## A Banking App
A simple banking application built with React, Redux, & Semantic UI

### Overview
- Redux reducers, actionTypes, and actions are organized according the the [Redux Ducks Proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).
- All React component related files (stylesheets, tests, and the component itself) are organized into component directories under `src/components` which provides a terse and easily discoverable file structure.
